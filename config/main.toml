AboutMeBody = "I'm a casino machine maintenance technician. Each weekend, you can find me with my energetic friend Candy (a hazel-colored Cocker Spaniel), playing at the park. I take saxofon lessons on Friday and I'm really into Celta Dune, my greatest passion. Sports are a huge part of my life. I spend a lot of time training and I'm pretty active in team sports."
